# CO2 Detection System

An IoT Project to keep track of the effect of CO2 Emissions on the Global Warming

### Hardware Part:

This project is using Node-MCU ESP8266 Wifi-Module, DHT 22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor, MQ7 CO2 Sensor.

### Software Part:

The Software part consists of 2 interactive GUIs (Android and Web Applications) with a single Dart codebase. This was possible thanks to the cross platform applications development provided by Flutter. 

### IoT Part:

The readings from the hardware part was then displayed theough the software GUI and the project was connected using Realtime Database from Firebase.

## Project Overview:

### The Hardware Taking Readings:

- The Sensors were installed near to a plant with the pulp as the light source (The Sun) to detect the CO2 Emissions in the glass container (Atmosphere) using the gas sensor
